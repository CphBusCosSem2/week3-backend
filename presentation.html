# ![](img/lotussm.png)  Week 3:  Java Servlets, JSP, JDBC
3 days of class session and daily exercises  
2 days of miniproject recapping the learning objectives from the last 3 weeks


---
## Day 1 - Java Servlets
![alt text](img/clientServer.png "client server image")  


- The architecture (client server with HTTP, POST and GET)
 - Look at dev. tools. i chrome to see what is communicated between client and Server.
- The anatomy of a java servlet
 - DoPost() and DoGet()
 - ProcessRequest() - run through the template
  - PrintWriter
  - getContextPath
 - HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse objects
- The usefull methods
 - Demo getting data from userform to java console
  - request.getParameter(String) to get data from user form
- The session object.


---
## Exercise day 1 -
Create an application that can register recipes from users


- Create an html form to get ingredients from the users
 - Let the form be dynamic so that the user can get input field for each ingredient
 - Also a text area for the howto of the recipe
- Collect the data on the server in a data collection (Must be static since HTTP is stateless)
- Create a toString method to show the content in a formattet way in the console.


---
## Day 2 - JSP (Java Server Pages)
![](img/clientServer.png)


- Architecture
 - Page Controller vs. Front Controller
- Setup a front controller example
 - use `&lt;hidden&gt;` form fields to communicate origin.
- 


---
## Exercise day 2
Continue from the exercise yesterday.


- Create a jsp page that can show all the recipes by name in a formatted user friendly manner.
- Make all the recipes clickable. Use a get request to tell server what recipe was clicked.
- Create a jsp page that can show a single recipe when it was clicked from the previous page
- Create a button in the the recipe details page that loads the recipe into form elements so data can be edited.


---
## Day 3 - JDBC - connection the application to database

- Persistence
- Setup JDBC driver
- Create working example with database connection
- Move data up and down between java collection and the database
- Get data from the db to show to user in html table
- Get data from user form and persist in db
- Setup example on how to upload picture to server and persist path in db
- ORM

---
## Exercise day 3 -
Continue from the exercise the two past days


- Now persist the data from the recipes website into db.
- Store pictures of the dishes in an img folder
- in db let each recipe have path to the image of the dish
- read the data from the db to show in jsp pages created earlier
- if thereï¿½s time: create a picture upload button on each recipe
 - when clicked the user should be able to upload additional images
 - these additional images should be shown too when the recipe is requested.


---
## CA1 - Fully implemented web application
[Create a web shop with Cupcakes ](Webshop.pdf)


- Create a database
- Add tables like user, invoice, orderline, bottom, topping
- Create JSP, CSS, Bootstrap, JS files for structure.
- Create Servlet to handle request and response from client to server
- Create Database Connection Class
- Create Entity classes
- Create mapper classes
- Create use cases for the app
- Create Database Facade class (based on use cases)
- Decide which jsp pages are needed for communicating with user
 - login, products page, order page, page of invoices.
- create js functions to create order and check users finances
